Revision history for Perl extension Linux::DVB::DVBT.

???
	- Fixed type rename to pidtype where used by example scripts

2.05 Wed Apr 21 12:00:00 2010
	- Corrected typo in dvbt-strength script
	- Fixed trsncode command escaping
	- Modified so that it's easier to add extra SI pids into the recording
	- Corrected bug when adding SI tables

2.04 Fri Apr 16 09:00:00 2010
	- Fixed error in dvbt-chans : file length with -extra-check was too large
	- Re-write of low-level epg functions to speed up the process (and stop lock ups)
	- Fixed errors in epg : loop checks were wrong (also increased buffer size)
	- Now sort the config files by tsid & pnr
	- Fixed error message when recording fails (attempted byte was reporting the pointer not the value)
	- Fixed bug in regexp of Utils::fix_episodes that required a word before the episode number
	- Split XS file into more manageable chunks
	- Fixed setting inversion parameter : use AUTO value where possible (rather than 0) 
	  (Reported as [rt.cpan.org #56362] Does not work with DiBcom 3000P/M-C DVB-T)
	- Corrected tuning timeout
	- Modified Ffmpeg module to allow other transcode commands to be added to the command list
		
2.03 Mon Apr 06 16:10:00 2010
	- Fixed error when recording to .ts file (transcoding should just check length)
	
2.02 Mon Apr 06 08:48:00 2010
	- Default to now add SI tables otherwise ffmpeg does not recognise the video stream encoding
	- Various bug fixes to multiplex recording
	- Minor pod tweaks
	
2.01 Mon Mar 22 12:20:00 2010
	- Added proper support for subtitles (now automatically records the PAT & PMT when required)
	- Fixes to module version numbers!
	- Minor pod tweaks
	
2.00 Fri Mar 19 12:20:00 2010
	- Major re-write to add multiplex recording capability
	- Added TVAnytime reqporting in epg 
	- Added subtitle stream pid to config files
	- Fixed bug in scan where frequency reported is less than the minimum required for DVB-T.

1.09 Thu Dec 17 09:23:00 2009
	- Fixed scan for the case where the centre frequency information is not correctly(?) transmitted by the broadcaster (i.e. Italy).
	  Module now (attempts to!) works out the frequency based on the program information gathered.


1.08 Thu Nov 19 12:00:00 2009
	- Added large file support (>2G) for recording. This is a compile time option that is enabled if your Perl build supports it.
	  If this is not supported on your system, then use dvbt-ffrec to get ffmpeg to handle the large recordings
	  (NOTE: This applies to recordings of approx 2hours or more)

1.07 Mon Nov 16 12:00:00 2009
	- Bug fix to scan. New code accounts for tuner cards that readback with the wrong frequency.

1.06 Tue Nov 03 08:00:00 2009
	- Major re-write of scanning logic to make it more robust (also checks signal strengths to choose best
	  transmitter when more than one is available for the same multiplex).
	- Added copious debug facilities to scan logic (including Hi-res timer!). If you have any problems with scanning
	  please re-run with '-verbose 15 -debug 15', direct stderr into a file, and send me the file.
	- Corrected some assumptions about the tuner hardware and frequency files (thanks to Arthur Gidlow for his help with this one)

1.05 Mon Oct 12 11:09:00 2009
	- Fixed typo in epg() method that caused program ids to be created using tsid-pnr rather than lcn
	- Corrected dvbt-ffrec to enclose output filename in quote
	- Numerous fixes to scan and epg related to multiple frequency handling (thanks to Thomas Rehn for his help in debugging)

1.04 Fri Oct 02 10:00:00 2009
	- I've finally worked out how to gather the logical channel number information for all of the channels.
	- Added 'merge' option flag to allow scan results to be merged with previous (default is to overwrite previous)
	- Now removes any channels that are not tv or radio; do not have a channel name; do not have the correct audio/video stream ids
	- Added dvbt-chans utility script
	
1.03  Wed Sept 30 12:30:00 2009
	- Corrected XS so that EPG strings are correctly terminated
	- Fixed genre string copying

1.02  Mon Sept 21 09:30:00 2009
	- Handle the case where a channel scans to have no name (use it's PR number instead)

1.01  Sat Jul 04 12:30:00 2009
	- Bug fix: corrected dvbt-devices script

1.00  Thu Jul 03 12:30:00 2009
	- Added default channel names for EPG
	- Fixed bug in epg() creating channel list
	- Added web check for later version

0.03  Fri Jan 23 12:30:00 2009
	- bug fix in channel name "fuzzy" find
	- improved/corrected documentation
	- updated makefile to install scripts
	- changed dvbt-scan to generate output during scan

0.02  Wed Dec 10 12:46:56 2008
	- Small modifications to build files to allow compile on x64 and FreeBSD

0.01  Wed Oct 15 19:46:56 2008
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-O -n Linux::DVB::DVBT -A Linux-DVB-DVBT/dvb_lib/dvb_lib.h
